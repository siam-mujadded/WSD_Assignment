# WSD_Assignment
A console based imdb like application. Using JAVA I created a console based movie searching, information provider application.
There are some basic classes like User, Movie. Also there will be a service class to provide services like searching, 
information providing etc. 

User class will have fields like name, email, age, address, etc.

Movie class will have name, genre, year of release, budget and cast.

Service class will have procedures like register, unregister, search_by_title, search_by_category, search_by_cast, get_details, add_moivies_to_favorites,
remove_movies_from_favorites, see_details, search_in_favorites.

Intitially the usser will be prompted to register with his email. Also there will be an exit option. The email should be validated as a valid email address. Then
the user will be given options of the services list and user can choose one of it entering a number. Then the user will be prompted
to the service. After getting the service user can again choose any one of the services and if the user wishes then he or she can 
log out of the system and terminate the program.
